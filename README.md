Logging Package for Go
======================

Simplistic logging package for Go. Logs generated by go-logger are written
to a file and displayed in standard output.

Usage
-----

Basic usage:

```Go
import logger "github.com/dragonrider23/go-logger"

appLogger := logger.New("app")
appLogger.Info("Application started")
appLogger.Warning("User not found")
appLogger.Fatal("Unhandled error occured") // Calls os.Exit(1)
```

To specify your own error level, use the Error function:

```Go
appLogger.Error("Notice", blue, "%s", "This is a notice", ...interface{})
```

You can also use the Get() func to call a specific logger:

```Go
logger.New("app")
logger.Get("app").Info("Error message")
```

Each logger is unique by name so you can specify which loggers can print to stdout and even
where each logger saves its log files as well as the timestampe format:

```Go
appLogger.Location("path/to/log/files") // Changes log file location
appLogger.NoStdout() // Disables stdout printing for the logger
appLogger.TimeCode("2006-01-02 15:04:05 MST") // Changes timestamp format
```

You can even chain multiple configuration functions together:

```Go
logger.New("request").Location("reqlogs").NoStdout()
```

Lastly, if you want to get rid of the logger (using the Get() syntax):

```Go
logger.Get("app").Close()
```

Versioning
----------

For transparency into the release cycle and in striving to maintain backward compatibility,
This application is maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines.
Sometimes we screw up, but we'll adhere to these rules whenever possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backward compatibility **bumps the major** while resetting minor and patch
- New additions without breaking backward compatibility **bumps the minor** while resetting the patch
- Bug fixes and misc changes **bumps only the patch**
